# xSDK Examples

The example codes provided here demonstrate the use of of various xSDK libraries in tandem to solve problems of 
interest.  Each of the library folders has one or more examples codes that are built of that library 
and utilize code integrations with other xSDK libraries.  Running these example codes and
examining the output is a good way to better understand how these libraries can work together. The
code samples are a good place to start for new projects.  More details about the examples can be found 
in the README.md files in the library subfolders.  For more information on the xSDK see <https://xsdk.info/>.

These examples are currently in the repo but will not be enabled in the xsdk-examples spack package until we release a new version of the xSDK.
They can still be built using CMake directly.

## Install the code samples

The examples can be installed along with the xSDK utilizing the spack package.
```
spack install xsdk-examples
```

Further details on how to run each example code can be found in each example folder's README.md file.
